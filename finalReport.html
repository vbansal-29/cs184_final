<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Our project implements a high-quality font rendering pipeline capable of rastering TrueType fonts using CPU and GPU approaches. Using the Arial font (1320 glyphs), we extract glyph outlines, reconstruct Bézier paths, and rasterize them into anti-aliased bitmap images. We improved our scanline fill, added performance timing, and now support batch rendering of the entire alphabet and arbitrary sentences. Our work explores the trade-offs between CPU and GPU rendering regarding visual fidelity and performance, culminating in an interactive demo, detailed timing benchmarks, and compelling visual results. This report details our technical approach, challenges, results, and lessons learned.
</p>

<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
<p>
<strong>Font Parsing and Outline Extraction:</strong> Our pipeline begins by loading the <code>Arial.ttf</code> font using <code>freetype-py</code>, which provides Python bindings to the FreeType library. We programmatically enumerate all 1320 glyphs in the font but focus our rendering on selected characters (e.g., the full alphabet and sentences). For each glyph, we use the <code>FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP</code> flag to force FreeType to provide only vector data, avoiding pre-rendered bitmaps and ensuring full access to the underlying geometric information. Each glyph comprises one or more contours, sequences of points marked as on-curve or off-curve. TrueType fonts use quadratic Bézier curves for outlines and may encode implicit on-curve points between consecutive off-curve points. Our extraction logic carefully parses the <code>contours</code> and <code>tags</code> arrays, reconstructing the correct sequence of on-curve and control points for each contour. We handle edge cases such as contours that wrap around, glyphs with multiple disjoint shapes (e.g., "O"), and special tags for composite glyphs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bézier Path Reconstruction and Validation:</strong> Once the raw points and tags are extracted, we reconstruct each glyph's outline as a series of line segments and quadratic Bézier curves. We insert implicit on-curve midpoints for consecutive off-curve points as per the TrueType specification. We then segment the contour into a list of primitives, distinguishing between straight lines and curves. To validate the correctness of our extraction and reconstruction, we plot the resulting paths using Matplotlib, overlaying control points (red), and on-curve points (black) for visual inspection. This step was crucial for debugging, as it allowed us to quickly identify and fix errors in point ordering, implicit point handling, and contour closure. We tested our extraction pipeline on a variety of glyphs, including complex ones with holes and multiple contours (e.g., "B," "O," "S").
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scanline Rasterization and Anti-Aliasing:</strong> The reconstructed paths are fed into our custom scanline rasterizer. The rasterizer first converts all Bézier curves into a polyline approximation by sampling each curve at regular intervals (using the quadratic Bézier formula). For each scanline (horizontal row of pixels), we compute all intersections with the polyline edges, sort them, and fill the regions between pairs of intersections according to the non-zero winding rule. This approach handles both filled shapes and interior holes. To address aliasing artifacts at edges, we implemented supersampling: the glyph is rasterized at a higher resolution (e.g., 4x), a Gaussian blur is applied to the high-res bitmap, and the result is downsampled to the target resolution by averaging pixel blocks. The <code>scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter</code> function is used for efficient blurring. The supersampling factor and blur sigma are tunable parameters, allowing us to trade off quality and performance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance Instrumentation and Batch Rendering:</strong> To better understand bottlenecks and optimize the pipeline, we added detailed timing measurements at each stage: path extraction, edge generation, scanline fill, Gaussian blur, and downsampling. These timings are printed for every glyph render and summarized in our results. Scanline fills, and blurring are the most expensive steps, especially for complex glyphs at high supersampling rates. To showcase the scalability of our approach, we implemented batch rendering of the entire alphabet (A–Z) and arbitrary sentences, assembling the results into grids or long canvases. This required careful management of spacing, canvas size, and memory usage. Our batch renderer can process dozens of glyphs in a single pass, and the timing benchmarks are visualized as bar plots for comparison.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Debugging, Validation, and Future GPU Work:</strong> Throughout development, we relied heavily on visualization for debugging—plotting outlines, control points, and filled bitmaps at various stages. We also compared our outputs to reference renderings from FreeType and commercial font engines. Modularizing the codebase into clear stages (parsing, path, rasterization) made testing and optimizing individual components easier. Our pipeline is designed to support GPU acceleration: the modular structure allows us to swap out the scanline fill with a fragment shader or compute kernel. The data structures are compatible with WebGL or OpenGL workflows. We have begun prototyping a GPU-based rasterizer using analytical coverage estimation and plan to integrate it with our interactive demo for real-time font rendering and benchmarking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Our technical approach combines careful adherence to font specifications, robust geometric algorithms, and practical engineering for performance and scalability. By instrumenting and validating each stage, we have built a flexible pipeline capable of producing high-quality, anti-aliased text renderings and supporting future research in GPU-accelerated font rendering.

<h2>Results</h2>

Our CPU renderer now supports batch rendering of the entire alphabet, arbitrary sentences, and individual glyphs. We measured and visualized timing for each stage of the pipeline. Supersampling-based anti-aliasing continues to improve visual clarity around curve edges significantly. Below are the updated results:
